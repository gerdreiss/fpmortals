-   scalaz-deriving
-   magnolia
-   shapeless
-   macros
-   export-hook
-   Property Testing (as a case study for Arbitrary)


# TODO Implementing the Application

Pad out the application implementation with everything we've learnt.

Will probably be a big chapter. Maybe best to leave it for a final
part of the book?


# TODO Haskell


# TODO Scala

The following should suffice (in this order)

-   object, val, def, if, primitives, types
-   trait, class, abstract class (construction, methods, inheritance / type hierarchy)
-   String, List and Future as examples (including a brief look at for)
-   case class and pattern matching
-   a brief introduction to implicit

ADTs, for, typeclasses and implicit, and algebras are covered in detail in the main body of my book. As well as many warnings about Future.
