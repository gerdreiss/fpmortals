# About This Book

This book is for the typical Scala developer, probably with a Java background,
who is both sceptical and curious about the **Functional Programming** (FP)
paradigm. This book justifies every concept with practical examples, including
writing a web application.

There are many ways to do Functional Programming in Scala. This book uses [scalaz
7.2](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz), the most popular, stable, principled and comprehensive framework. You could
instead use the Cats political fork of scalaz, or roll your own framework.

This book is designed to be read from cover to cover, in the order presented,
with a rest between chapters. Earlier chapters encourage coding styles that we
will later discredit: similar to how we learn Newton's theory of gravity as
children, and progress to Riemann / Einstein / Maxwell if we become students of
physics.

A computer is not necessary to follow along, although we hope that you will gain
the confidence to independently study the scalaz source code. Some of the more
complex code snippets are available with [the book's source code](https://bitbucket.org/fommil/fpmortals/src/) and those who
want practical exercises are encouraged to (re-)implement scalaz (and the
example application) using the partial descriptions presented in this book.

We also recommend [The Red Book](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) as further reading. It teaches how to write an FP
library in Scala from first principles. Try to attend a Fantasyland Institute of
Learning training course if you can.

# Practicalities

If you'd like to set up a project that uses the libraries presented in
this book, you will need to use a recent version of Scala with
FP-specific features enabled (e.g. in `build.sbt`):

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  scalaVersion in ThisBuild := "2.12.12"
  scalacOptions in ThisBuild ++= Seq(
    "-language:_",
    "-Ypartial-unification",
    "-Xfatal-warnings"
  )
  
  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.github.mpilquist" %% "simulacrum"     % "0.12.0",
    "org.scalaz"           %% "scalaz-core"    % "7.2.22"
  )
  
  addCompilerPlugin("org.spire-math" %% "kind-projector" % "0.9.6")
  addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.1.1" cross CrossVersion.full)
~~~~~~~~

In order to keep our snippets short, we will omit the `import`
section. Unless told otherwise, assume that all snippets have the
following imports:

{lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
  import scalaz._, Scalaz._
  import simulacrum._
~~~~~~~~
